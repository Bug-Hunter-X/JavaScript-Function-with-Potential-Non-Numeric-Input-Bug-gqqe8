This repository contains a simple JavaScript function with a potential bug related to handling non-numeric inputs. The bug is demonstrated, and a solution is provided to handle this error gracefully. The original code performs addition on two input parameters. If these parameters are not numbers, the result might be unexpected due to JavaScript's implicit type coercion. The solution adds input validation to check if the input parameters are numbers. If not, an error message is thrown, or a default value is used, ensuring that the function behaves as intended even with unexpected inputs.
